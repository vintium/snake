# Snake
A powerful, modern language with the low-level, no-nonsense semantics of C and the beautiful, pythonic syntax of python.

Classic Hello, World program in Snake:
```c
import stdio.h

int main(void):
    printf("Hello, World!\n")
    return 0
```

## Quickstart
`snakec` is a simple, crossplatform compiler for the Snake language. use it to compile a snake program:
```console
$ ./snakec example.snake
$ ./example
```
